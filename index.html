          scholarships to support students from financially weaker sections and
          marginalized communities. These scholarships aim to promote
          <b>equity, accessibility, and inclusivity</b> in higher education by
          easing the burden of tuition fees, academic expenses, and essential
          living costs. Alongside university-level scholarships, students will
          also be informed about <b>other scholarship opportunities</b> through
          official communication channels.
